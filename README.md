# UFOs

This is the repository for the Module 11 Challenge. I've created and build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. Also, created filters to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing.

To view, please clone the repository and open the html file in your browser. 

## Overview of Project

The purpose of the project was to build an easy to read and filter table using JavaScript. 
The table contains information about UFO sightings around the world, and can then be filtered to a specific Date, City, State, Country, or UFO shape. 
The table is presented on HTML page that can be shared with others.

The app is created using JavaScript that will pull information on UFO sightings from a source file, display the data, and filter it as various parameters are entered. 

## Results

To use the webpage, open the index.html file. To filter the table, simply enter the desired info you would like to see results for.

Created a page that looks clean and allows the user to filter through the different sitings of data set using the search bars. There is always room for improvement. There are two data factor that could be added to improve this website.
One piece of data that could benefit to the information presented in the website is information like how many people were at the site.
